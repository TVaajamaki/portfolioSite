Last Train is a VR Escape room game set in the Japanese Metro system, 2018. (8 Person team)
<br/><br/>
Created during a 3 month (2 months for half of the team) exchange period at Trident College in Nagoya, Japan. The Team featured members from Finland, Japan and Singapore.
<br/><br/>
My main role on the project was creating item and environment based interactions. I also ended up doing some light 3D-modeling, voice recording and general audio editing.

Ainu 4044 is a 2D action boss-fight-based game from 2018 created with Unity. (6 Person team)
<br/><br/>
It started out as a 20-ish day summer class project (these gifs are from that Alpha version), and is currently (2018) being worked on in Kajaani.
<br/><br/>
For the Alpha I was the sole programmer on the project, and created all basic gameplay systems and boss scripting.

Fliegenstad is a 2D visual novel puzzle(ish) game from 2017 made with Unity. (5 Person team)
<br/><br/>
Made during a three month university course, I was the sole programmer on this project. The game is heavily reliant on scripting with few actual original systems.
<br/><br/>
The main programming challenge was creating a dialog system that could incorporate player choice and alter scenes accordingly.

<div class="textBlock">
LoadQuest was an experiment in using Lua scripting with the Defold game engine, 2018. (7 Person team)
<br/><br/>
Mobile 2D dungeon-crawling game for Android with light randomization for the dungeon layouts. Not a great success but functional on a good day. 
<br/><br/>
It was an opportunity to learn both a new language in Lua and gain a better understanding of version control with three programmers on the team.

BuildChopper was one of the first Unity projects I created, back in 2015. (Solo)
<br/><br/>
A very rough prototype for how different types of vehicles would work using Unity physics. 
Switching between different points-of-view and camera styles to complete "puzzles".
